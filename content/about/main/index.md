intro: |
  I recently graduated from Macquarie University with a degree in Applied Statistics and have a passion for data analytics. I am eager to put my technical skills, such as R, SQL, Tableau, and Excel, to use and continue growing in this field. I believe that learning is a lifelong journey and am always open to new challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge.
  
  When I'm not working on data, you can find me exploring new destinations, practicing the piano, reading a good book, or soaking up the sights and sounds of Sydney where I currently call home. I am a friendly and easy-going individual who values collaboration, innovation, and growth.
  
  I am looking for opportunities in the industry to work with a team that shares these values and where I can make a positive impact through my skills and dedication. If you're looking for a team player who is eager to learn and grow, let's connect!
