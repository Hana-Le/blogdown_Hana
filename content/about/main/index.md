  I’m a recent graduate in Applied Statistics with a passion for data analytics. My background includes six years of experience in project management. I am now seeking opportunities to apply and further develop my skills in statistical modeling, machine learning, and data visualization. On this site, I share my projects and insights on the latest trends in data science. I am open to opportunities in industry, and I would love to work with a team that values accuracy and efficiency.
