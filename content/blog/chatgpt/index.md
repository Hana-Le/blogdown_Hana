## be careful as it may makeup facts

ChatGPT is a really cool chatbot using Natural Language Processing model developed by OpenAI. You may have heard alot about or used chatGPT lately. I have been using it for quite some time now and I have to say it's amazing. I started using it out of curiosity and now I use it regularly to enhance my writing skills. I was even surprised to see that it can quickly write simple R codes.


ChatGPT is indeed a game changer and has sparked an AI war among major tech companies. A few days ago, Google launched a demo of new AI chatbot tool Bard, but it failed to provide the correct answer to a knowledge-based question [(link)]( https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/08/tech/google-ai-bard-demo-error/index.html). This reminded me of a tweet I saw in early December, where ChatGPT answered a statistical question incorrectly (picture attached). I even tried it again recently and the answer was a bit different, but still incorrect. :smiley:

The point is, chatGPT can answer very confidently and use all the right statistical terms, but it can still be misleading if you don't have a good understanding of statistics. The leader of OpenAI, Mira Murati, mentioned it in an interview with [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-may-make-up-facts-openai-cto-mira-murati-says-2023-2) that ChatGPT might not always be accurate. So, we should be cautious when relying on chatGPT for information and should verify the answers it provides if necessary.

P/s: Hana is dumb, ChatGPT is always awesome. You don't need to double check, believe me!
